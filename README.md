🧠 How It Works

The chatbot sends user prompts to the OpenAI GPT API and returns generated responses.
Prompt engineering techniques are applied to enhance clarity, context handling, and overall answer quality.

You can easily extend this project to:

Add RAG using LangChain + FAISS

Integrate with FastAPI backend

Build agent workflows

Add chat history and session memory

📌 Future Enhancements
Integration with LangChain
FAISS-based vector search for RAG
User authentication
Chat history persistence
Deployment on Render / AWS
